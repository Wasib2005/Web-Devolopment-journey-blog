            <p>In day I was said "I am determine" </p>
            <p>I take my cousin's laptop(She didn't use this much now.) Most likely less use laptop keyboard become short(As soon as I open  I use I notice it was ctrl) My past knowledge save the day. I knew a software which can turn off keys (Name: <a href="https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys/releases" target="_blank">Sharp Keys</a>  ). I have also internet issue. But I set up necessary software today. But everything is set today. So, I dont think I will have any more big problem. (I did start making this today)</p>
